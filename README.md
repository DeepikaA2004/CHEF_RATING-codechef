# CHEF_RATING-codechef
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Chef has been working hard to compete in MasterChef.
He is ranked 

X out of all contestants. However, only
10 contestants would be selected for the finals.

Check whether Chef made it to the top 
10 or not?

 ## Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one integer 
X â€” the current rank of Chef.
## Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if Chef made it to the top 
10 and NO otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings NO, no, nO, and No will be treated as equivalent.

## Constraints
1<=T<=100
1<X<=100
## Sample 1:
 ### Input                 OUTPUT
     15                     NO
     10                     YES
     1                      YES
     50                     NO

## Explanation:
Test case 
1: Chef's rank is 15
15 which is greater than 
10. Thus, Chef did not make it to the top 
10.

Test case 
2
2: Chef's rank is 
10

Test case
